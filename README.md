# This extension is no longer being developed by the main developer

Tumblr Batch Plugin was not working and not available on the Chrome store as a result of not being maintained. Thusly, it was broken when downloading and installing both the github repository's develop and release zip files.

For chromium-based browsers to install and accept the extension, it necessitates having the JQuery file used to develop it, in the extension folder itself, unlike what I recall in 2021 when I last used it.

So to start with, this is just to make it operational without adding any features nor fixing any other bugs yet. As close to plug-and-play a browser extension can be without being in the browser extension store. It only works in chromium-based browsers still. I cannot promise that I will commit to developing this.

# Tumblr Batch Block

This extension allows you to block many Tumblr bloggers at a time, and save time doing it. You can input lists you've created yourself, or use lists others have created and shared with you.

## Installation and Use

1. Tumblr Batch Block is no longer on Chrome Store so you have to download by clicking the big "Code" button on this page, and click "download as ZIP".

2. Go to where you downloaded the ZIP file, and unzip it.

3. Go to your chromium-based browser's settings, then to "extensions". Turn on "developer mode". Click "load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder. It should be installed.

4. Navigate to your [settings page](https://tumblr.com/settings/blog) on Tumblr. (The link will take you to your main blog. You can run the extension from any of your blogs' settings pages.)

3. Click the extension icon. There will be a pop-up box.

### Blocking

1. Click "Block the List".

2. Enter a comma separated list of blog names (eg "staff, testblog, gettingblocked", sans quotation marks).

3. Leave the tab open until the extension has run through the entire list. You can switch tabs and continue surfing the web while it works.

### Exporting your blocklist

1. Click "Export Blocklist".

2. Wait for Tumblr Batch Block to collect all of the blogs you have blocked.

3. A text box will appear at the top of the sidebar with a list of blogs you have blocked.
